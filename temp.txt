Hereâ€™s a well-crafted prompt you can give ChatGPT to analyze your dataset comparisons across the DBMSs (Oracle, PostgreSQL, DuckDB, SQL Server, SQLite), separating vertical and horizontal comparisons, and pulling out insights based on accuracy, performance, and dataset context:

---

**ðŸ“Œ Prompt to Use:**

> Iâ€™ve attached query result data for similarity metric evaluations across five DBMSs (DuckDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite). Each DBMS was tested on the same name-matching task using various similarity metrics (e.g., Soundex, Edit Distance, Jaro-Winkler, Jaccard/Trigram).  
>
> Please perform two levels of analysis:
>
> ### ðŸ”¹ Vertical Comparison:
> Compare the performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, runtime) of the same similarity metric **across different DBMSs**. For example, compare how Soundex performed on "Johnathan" or "Katheryne" across all five DBMSs.
> - For each similarity metric, identify which DBMS performed best.
> - Highlight meaningful differences in metrics like precision/recall trade-offs and runtimes.
> - Offer **insightful reasons** why certain DBMSs might have performed better or worse (e.g., implementation differences, internal optimizations, etc.).
>
> ### ðŸ”¹ Horizontal Comparison (DuckDB):
> Within **DuckDB**, compare the performance of the different similarity metrics (Soundex, Edit Distance, Jaro-Winkler, Jaccard/Trigram) when tested on the names "Johnathan" and "Katheryne".
> - Identify which metric(s) gave the highest F1-scores and most balanced performance.
> - Explain **why** these metrics performed well or poorly using dataset context (SSA name list with typographical variations and phonetic variants).
>
> Finally, summarize:
> - Which DBMS is best for each similarity metric
> - Which similarity metric is most reliable and why (from DuckDB results)
> - Any key insights or patterns you observe (e.g., Jaccard underperforming with phonetic variation, Soundex missing typos, etc.)
