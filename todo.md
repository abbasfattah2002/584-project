Put an X inside the checkbox when it's done
- [X] Settle on name regex
  - Turns out using grep -E is not 1:1 with DuckDB's matching

- [X] Install DBMS:
	- [X] PostgreSQL
	- [X] Microsoft SQL Server
	- [X] sqlite
	- [X] Oracle
- [X] Figure out how to dump DuckDB results to csv
- [ ] Create script for comparing results from csv's
- [X] Create queries for vertical comparisons (for each DBMS)
	- [X] PostgreSQL
	- [X] Microsoft SQL Server
	- [X] sqlite
	- [X] Oracle
- [ ] Choose metric+thresholds for the horizontal comparison
- [ ] Create fuzzed name dataset (dataset with typos) (optional?)
- [X] Implement Union/Intersect custom similarity metric
- [ ] C++ udfs(?)
- [X] Find out what we can pull from the profiler (kinda?)
